# PhD Simulator

## About

Technically a random event driven text-based game.

You can [play it here](https://research.wmz.ninja/projects/phd/index.html) (using modern browsers or mobile devices).

Random events are defined in [YAML files](static/rulesets/default). Therefore, the game is easily moddable,

Currently the GUI code is purely vanilla, and kind of messy. I may clean it up if I have time.

## Play
We have a Chinese version now. You can [play it here](https://phd.enderfga.cn/).

The original author also provided a Chinese version, which I believe would be [a better choice](https://research.wmz.ninja/projects/phd/index.zh-hans.html)
